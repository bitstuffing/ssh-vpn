# SSH-VPN

VPN throw SSH for Android

## Getting Started

This project at this moment is a starting point, and it's a dev. version.
Now the target is get a mobile app with an Android service, create a VPN and share 
this connection with the mobile.

It's just an imitation based on Ki4a app but not with old Android code, which
doesn't work on current Android 12.
